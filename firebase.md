### Key Differences
- **Flexibility**: Azure offers more flexibility for custom enterprise-grade solutions, while Firebase is more tailored for mobile and web apps.
- **Scalability**: Azure services are designed to scale for large enterprise applications and diverse workloads.
- **Integration**: Azure integrates deeply with other Microsoft services, making it ideal for organizations already using the Microsoft ecosystem.

If you are looking to replicate Firebase-like functionality on Azure, you'll often need to combine multiple Azure services tailored to your application's needs.
